# PyEncryptor
Two different 'encryptors' written in Python 3.
Please keep in mind that this isn't really encryption, it just fills the entered string with gibberish.

The program entitled "no_password_encryptor.py" does not ask for password authentication when decrypting data.
The program entitled "password_encryptor.py" prompts for a password when encrypting and will not decrypt the data unless the password is entered successfully during decryption.

By using these programs or any code written within them, you agree that I am not responsible for anything that this program or it's code is used for. Like I said, this doesn't really encrypt data, it just fills it with gibberish. Please do not use this program to encrypt important and/or valuable information.

That being said, please enjoy these programs!

By the way: I didn't add any comments in "no_password_encryptor.py" and some of the variable names are confusing. I made all of these edits in "password_encryptor.py" so I recommend taking a look at that if you want to learn how it works.
